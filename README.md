# User Experience (UX)

### Ideal client


The ideal client for this business is:

-	English speaking
-	Friends fan
-   A person who watched the series 
-   Individuals, couples, families, or groups

Visitors of this website search for:

-	A knowledgeable site, where they can find story-based questions and challenging, engaging answer options 

This website is the best way to help them achieve these goals because:

- Most other similar sites are limited in their quiz games to a general Friends quiz, while this website offeres individual questionnaires for each characters
- The website also offers true story-based question scenarios and 4 answers to choose from that are just challenging enough


This website:

-	Is easy to navigate due to its sticky hamburger menu button scrolls with the user on all pages.
-   Gives the customers options and access to useful and learnable information.
-   Gives the customers the information they need without overloading them or distracting them from their original ideas  
    or wishes.
-   Guides them and their curiosity to the goal of the website
-   Has social media site buttons in the footer, which open them up in new tabs in order to not distract the customers  
    away from the website but a great help for the developer to showcase her other projects and work.

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing the website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile has scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse Accessibility](readme-images/accessibility_lighthouse_mobile%26desktop.png "Lighthouse Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for the Quiz logo and character buttons is Shadows Into Light, this was chosen because I found this font to be the closest to the one displayed in the title of the series. Therefore the user associates straight away to the topic of the website, without much explanation. 

![Shadows Into Light Font](readme-images/Shadows%20Into%20Light-font.png "Shadows Into Light Font")

The secondary font used for the body is Ubuntu which was selected for its clear readability, that works well with Shadows Into Light to maintain the cheerful and fun outcome.

![Ubuntu Font](readme-images/Ubuntu-font.png "Ubuntu Font")

I also chose a third font for the footer text, Quicksand, as I wanted to implement a much lighter font for that purpose, not to be distractive for the user.

# Features

The Friends Quiz website includes 2 pages; Home and the instruction page; 'How to play?'. All the pages are accessible through the hamburger menu shown at the top of the screen at all times. At the end of each game there is an extra 'Home' button to return to the Home page and so the user can choose a character again if they wish to start a new game. 

The pages include:
A navigation hamburger bar that allows the customers to navigate to each of the main pages of the site. The hamburger menu is fixed so it will follow the customer scrolling down the pages, giving them easier access to navigate again. Upon hovering over each of the hamburger menu links they'll also be changing their backgrounds to show the viewer where they are clicking. 

![Hamburger Menu](readme-images/hamburger-bar.png "Hamburger Menu")

![Open Hamburger Menu](readme-images/hamburger-bar-open.png "Open Hamburger Menu")

A footer is displayed at the bottom of each page which displays the contact information of the web developer, Copyright information with a disclaimer and links to LinkedIn and Github for the viewers to be able to get in contact with the developer.

![Footer](readme-images/footer.png "Footer")

#### Home

The Home page features a logo image, that instantly makes the theme of the website understandable to the user. It has the header - a navigation hamburger menu displayed as a fixed feature. The logo image also has a cover text on it with a text that explains the purpose of the website straight away. The purpose of these elements is to give a great first impression on arriving at the website, with the straight forward suggestion to the purpose itself.  

![Logo](readme-images/top-part.png "Logo")

After the log/hero image, there is an encouraging text that is a button at the same time, taking the user to the section where they can start the game. When this link is clicked, the soundtrack of the sitcom starts, giving extra dynamics to the page. The text starts with a common speaker icon to make sure that the user understands that it will be noisy, in case they are at a place where that would be inappropriate or simply doesn't want to listen any audio at the moment. There are also 2 buttons to control the audio underneath. In case the user doesn't want to listen the music, they can stop it straight away, or also restart it. The buttons are edited font icons, featuring the common 'play' and 'stop' signs for the sake of common understanding of what those buttons are for. The also zoom out and change colours when the user hover over them to see which button is clicked.   

![Navigation and audio buttons](readme-images/audio-part.png "Navigation and audio buttons")

After this section there are 6 buttons with the name of each characters on them. When the user clicks on them, the buttons will take them onto the next 'window' of the page, which is a personalized quiz based on the choosen character.

![Character choosing buttons](readme-images/character-buttons.png "Character choosing buttons")

After clicking on the buttons the second 'window' will be displayed and the first one with the audio buttons and the character choosing buttons will be invisible. (There is a third 'window' too, that one is also invisible at this stage.)
With that the quiz starts, with 10 questions and 4 multiple choice answers designed for the 6 characters each.

![Quiz window](readme-images/quiz-window.png "Quiz window")

This window also features a progress bar on the top left corner with blue color. With this the user can keep track which question they are at out of 10 and so their progess.

![Progress bar](readme-images/progressbar.png "Progress bar")

On the same line with the progress bar, on the top right corner there is a score counter with green color. The user can keep track of their scores, or correct answers.

![Score display](readme-images/score-display.png "Score display")

Under the progress bar and the score counter there is the quiz itself, displaying 10 different questions and 4 multiple choice answer to each questions, respectively to the 6 characters also. The questions come up in a random order, so each round feels a little bit different.

![Quiz](readme-images/quiz.png "Quiz")

When the user finishes with all 10 questions the third 'window', the final-results-window, becomes visible, and the other two invisible.

![Final result window](readme-images/final-results-window.png "Final result window")

First a text makes it understandable that the quiez has ended, then the relevant message gets displayed too. This message is based on the achieved points by the user. 

![Final result](readme-images/final-result.png "Final result")

And lastly a home button that is the same violet colour as the hamburger menu, suggesting that it is for navigation, as well. The user can navigate back to the first window to choose a character again, and restart if wishes to. 

![Home button](readme-images/home-button.png "Home button")

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they find. Position of the text in cover-text was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page. They also reported that the dropdown menu doesn't work in an efficient way when viewed on mobile screens with Safari browser. Instead of a simple tap, they have to press the button for a longer period of time in order to drop down. In every other case, it worked perfectly, on Safari desktop screen size including.

## Acknowledgments

I received inspiration for this project from my sister's and friends' as well as my own obsessions with the sitcom and I have also checked out works of other students for scope and what's best practice for a Mile stone project 2. 

I also would like to say a big thank you to my mentor Elaine Roche who guided me through this project and gave me the idea of flipping windows and the nested array to keep the file numbers to the minimum after I arrived with roughly 15 files to our second session, as well as some UX tips!
