# Friends, The Quiz

This website is for all users who are fans of the sitcom, Friends, who watched the series and have good memories with it. The users can test their knowledge of the characters and the series in general as the website is offering a selection of quiz questions dedicated to each friend’s character. It is a fun way for the user to refresh their memory of the topic. At the end of each quiz, they can see their results, and how many points they received. 

Of course, the game is designed to be easily used on any device and so to be inclusive. This means that the site needs to be responsive, allowing visitors to view it on any sized device without losing the quality of the experience. The site's main focus is to be engaging, colourful and motivating while providing real story-based questions and true answers.

[I Am Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://lilla-kavecsanszki.github.io/friends-quiz/)

The business goals of this website are:
  -	Provide high-quality questionnaires based on the sitcom
  -	Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to discover all features and then invite their friends too for a game; the sticky hamburger menu button is an excellent addition for easier and hassle-free navigation throughout the website.

The customer goals of this website are:
  -	Search for a fun site, where they can test their knowledge of the sitcom
  -	A website where they can find a character-based game, to be able to choose a selected quiz based on their favourite character or to have a different one for each friend, and not just a generalised Friends quiz like, on other websites.

# User Experience (UX)

### Ideal client

The ideal client for this business is:

-	English speaking
-	Friends fan
-	A person who watched the series
-	Individuals, couples, families, or groups

Visitors of this website search for:
-	A knowledgeable site, where they can find story-based questions and challenging, engaging answer options

This website is the best way to help them achieve these goals because:
-	Most other similar sites are limited in their quiz games to a general Friends quiz, while this website offers individual 
  questionnaires for each character
-	The website also offers true story-based question scenarios and 4 answers to choose from that are just challenging enough

This website:
-	Is easy to navigate by the sticky hamburger menu button scrolls for the user on all pages.
-	Gives the customers options and access to useful and learnable information.
-	Gives the customers the information they need without overloading them or distracting them from their original ideas or 
  wishes.
-	Guides them by their curiosity about the goal of the website.
-	Has social media site buttons in the footer, which open the sites up in new tabs in order to not distract the customers 
  away from the website. It also serves as a great help for the developer to showcase her other projects and work.

### User stories

1.	As a viewer of the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need, most importantly, to find 
    the quiz efficiently.

3.	As a viewer of the website, I want to be able to see my final result and progression in the meantime.
4.	As an interested observer and/or hiring manager, I want to be able to find the web developer and see other projects 
    from her on social media and industry-relevant sites.

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing the website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile has scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse Accessibility](readme-images/accessibility-lighthouse-test.png "Lighthouse Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

![A11y Test](readme-images/a11y-test.png "A11y Test")

# Design

### Colour Scheme

- Bright yellow #f8d649
- Very dark (mostly black) cyan #141c1e
- Dark moderate lime green #48a04f
- Bright red #ed3833
- Soft blue #44aedd
- Moderate violet #8f4ec4  
- Whitesmoke #f5f5f5

![My Colour Palette](readme-images/colorkit.png "My Colour Palette")

[My Colour Palette](https://colorkit.co/palette/f5f5f5-f8d649-48a04f-44aedd-8f4ec4-ed3833-141c1e/)

I picked these specific colours based on the colours and shades that were used in original Friends logos and materials or the closest to those. I made that decision for cheerful and fun aesthetics and to hope for an instant reaction and realisation from the visitor.

[Back to top](https://github.com/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/friends-quiz#contents)

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for the Quiz logo and character buttons is Shadows Into Light. It was chosen because I found this font to be the closest to the one displayed in the title of the series. Therefore, the user associates straight away with the topic of the website, without much explanation.

![Shadows Into Light Font](readme-images/Shadows%20Into%20Light-font.png "Shadows Into Light Font")

The secondary font used for the body is Ubuntu, which was selected for its clear readability, which works well with Shadows Into Light to maintain the cheerful and fun outcome.

![Ubuntu Font](readme-images/Ubuntu-font.png "Ubuntu Font")

I also chose a third font for the footer text, Quicksand, as I wanted to implement a much lighter font for that purpose, to not be distractive for the user.

![Quicksand Font](readme-images/Quicksand-font.png "Quicksand Font")

# Features

The Friends Quiz website includes 2 pages; Home and the instruction page, called 'How to play?'. All the pages are accessible through the hamburger menu shown at the top of the screen at all times. At the end of each game, there is an extra 'Home' button to return to the Home page and so the user can choose a character again if they wish to start a new game.

The pages include: A navigation hamburger bar that allows the customers to navigate to each of the main pages of the site. The hamburger menu is fixed so it will follow the customer scrolling down the pages, giving them easier access to navigate again. Upon hovering over each of the hamburger menu links they'll also be changing their backgrounds to show the viewer where they are clicking.
 

![Hamburger Menu](readme-images/hamburger-bar.png "Hamburger Menu")

![Open Hamburger Menu](readme-images/hamburger-bar-open.png "Open Hamburger Menu")

A footer is displayed at the bottom of each page which displays the contact information of the web developer, Copyright information with a disclaimer and links to LinkedIn and GitHub for the viewers to be able to get in contact with the developer.

![Footer](readme-images/footer.png "Footer")

#### Home

The Home page features a logo image, that instantly makes the theme of the website understandable to the user. It has the header - a navigation hamburger menu displayed as a fixed feature. The logo image also has a cover text on it with a text that explains the purpose of the website straight away. The purpose of these elements is to give a great first impression upon arriving at the website, with a straightforward suggestion to the purpose itself. 

![Logo](readme-images/top-part.png "Logo")

After the logo/hero image, there is an encouraging text that is a button at the same time, taking the user to the section where they can start the game. When this link is clicked, the soundtrack of the sitcom starts, giving extra dynamics to the page. The text starts with a common speaker icon to make sure that the user understands that it will have sound, in case they are at a place where that would be inappropriate or simply don’t want to listen to any audio at the moment. There are also two buttons to control the audio underneath. In case the user doesn't want to listen to the music, they can stop it straight away, or also restart it. The buttons are edited font icons, featuring the common 'play' and 'stop' signs for the sake of a common understanding of what those buttons are for. They also zoom out and change colours when the user hovers over them to see which button is clicked.   

![Navigation and audio buttons](readme-images/audio-part.png "Navigation and audio buttons")

After this section, there are six buttons with the name of each character on them. When the user clicks on them, the buttons will take them to the next 'window' of the page, which is a personalised quiz based on the chosen character.

![Character choosing buttons](readme-images/character-buttons.png "Character choosing buttons")

After clicking on the buttons, the second 'window' will be displayed and the first one with the audio buttons and the character-choosing buttons will be invisible. (There is a third 'window' too, which is also invisible at this stage.) With that, the quiz starts, with 10 questions and 4 multiple-choice answers each designed for the 6 characters.

![Quiz window](readme-images/quiz-window.png "Quiz window")

This window also features a progress bar in the top left corner with blue colour. With this, the user can keep track of which question they are at out of 10 and so their progress.

![Progress bar](readme-images/progressbar.png "Progress bar")

On the same line as the progress bar, in the top right corner, there is a score counter with green colour. The user can keep track of their scores, or correct answers.

![Score display](readme-images/score-display.png "Score display")

Under the progress bar and the score counter, there is the quiz itself, displaying 10 different questions and 4 multiple choice answers to each question, respectively to the six characters as well. The questions come up in a random order, so each round feels a little bit different.

![Quiz](readme-images/quiz.png "Quiz")

When the user finishes with all ten questions the third 'window', the final-results-window becomes visible, and the other two become invisible.

![Final result window](readme-images/final-results-window.png "Final result window")

First, the final point count gets displayed

![Final result](readme-images/final-result.png "Final result")

Then a text also makes it clear that the quiz has ended, and then the relevant message gets displayed too. This message is based on the achieved points by the user.

![Feedback](readme-images/message.png "Feedback")

And lastly, a home button that is the same violet colour as the hamburger menu, suggesting that it is for navigation, as well. The user can navigate back to the first window to choose a character again, and restart if wishes to. 

![Home button](readme-images/home-button.png "Home button")

#### How to Play? 

On the top, the title is displayed, confirming that the user is on the correct page. 

![Title](readme-images/how-to-play.png "Title")

Underneath there is an encouraging paragraph then the explanation of the website, which is about the instructions along with some references from the series.

![Instructions](readme-images/instructions.png "Instructions")

Under the instructions section, there is an animated Thanksgiving turkey with sunglasses. This is a funny reference from the series to set the mood for the webpage.

![Turkey](readme-images/turkey.png "Turkey")

## Manual Testing

**Home Page:**

**Hamburger menu:** Go to the "Home" page from a desktop. Change the screen size from desktop to tablet to verify that the hamburger menu is naturally responsive and works as expected, as unfolds and drops down with no issues. Click on each navigation menu item and verify that it links to the correct page. Hover over the menu buttons and verify the hover colour change work as expected.

**Logo image:** Go to the "Home" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the image responds correctly and looks good.

**Cover-text on top of the logo image:** Go to the "Home" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the text in this section responds correctly and looks good on all device widths. I had to adjust positioning for this on smaller screen sizes to keep its original place and therefore a responsive reaction.

**The window container (#main-window):** Go to the "Home" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the texts and other elements in these sections respond correctly and look good on all device widths.

**Let's start link:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the text responds correctly and looks good on all device widths. Click on the link item and verify that it links to the correct part of the page and takes the user to the character buttons to be able to choose one. Hover over the link and verify the hover colour change work as expected. Click on the link item and the audio starts as expected. The speaker icon at the beginning warns the user that the link will have sound.

**Audio control buttons:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the icon buttons display behave and centre as expected and that they look good on all device widths. Hover over the buttons and verify the hover colour change work as expected as well as the zoom-out animation. Click the stop button and the audio stops. Click the play button and the audio carries on from where it was stopped beforehand. If the audio finished, clicking the play button would start over the audio from the beginning.

**Character buttons:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the character buttons display behave and centre as expected and that they look good on all device widths. I had to adjust the flex-direction to column for this on smaller screen sizes to move the buttons under each other for readability and a responsive reaction. Hover over the buttons and verify the hover colour change work as expected. Click any of the character buttons and their relevant quiz game will start and the "quiz-window" gets visible to display the quiz. I can confirm that after this step the "choosing-window" or the "final-results-window" are not visible.

**"quiz-window":**
**Question:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the text responds correctly and looks good on all device widths. A new question pops up 800 milliseconds after the previous answer has been chosen.

**Answer choice container bars:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the bars respond correctly and look good on all device widths. Four multiple-choice answers display at the same time as the question. Hover over the bars and verify the hover zoom-out works as expected. Click on the correct answer and verify the colour change to green works as expected. Click on the three wrong answers and verify the colour change to red works as expected. Click on any answers at the tenth question and verify that the "final-results-window" gets visible to display the final result of the quiz. I can confirm that after this step the "choosing-window" or the "quiz-window" are not visible. 

**Score counter:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the score counter responds correctly, keeps its position and looks good on all device widths. Click on the correct answer (answer choice container bars) and verify the score adds 1 point to its previous state. Start a new quiz for the same or different character and verify that the Score number goes back to 0 as a starting value.

**Progress bar:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the progress bar responds correctly, keeps its position and looks good on all device widths. Click on any of the answers (answer choice container bars) and verify the progress bar adds 1 to the question counter out of 10 and the bar's colour-fill grows respectively also based on the percentage. Start a new quiz for the same or different character and verify that the progress bar returns to its starting position, that is question 1.

**"final-results-window":** 
**Final result points:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the text display behaves and centres as expected and that it looks good on all device widths. The number shows the correct result which is the same number as the score counter point after the tenth question was answered.

**Encouragnig message:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the texts display behaves and centres as expected and that they look good on all device widths. I confirm that the first sentence stays the same at every round but the second, encouraging message changes to three different messages based on the achieved final points. Go through the quiz and verify that the "End of the quiz!\n Hooray !! You are a true friend!" gets displayed if the user's final point was 8 or higher. The "End of the quiz!\n Not bad!" message gets displayed if the user's final point was 5 or higher. And the "End of the quiz!\n Better Luck next time!" message gets displayed if the user's final point was 4 or smaller.

**Home button:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the button display behaves and centres as expected and that it looks good on all device widths. Hover over the button and verify the hover zoom-out animation work as expected. Click on the link item and verify that it links to the correct part of the page and takes the user back to the top of the first stage of the home page with the “choosing-window” displayed, to be able to restart and choose a character again. I can confirm that after this step the "final-results-window" or the "quiz-window" are not visible.

**Footer:** Click on each social media icon to confirm they open in a separate tab for their links. Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the footer is responsive and looks good on all device widths. I had to adjust padding-bottom for this on smaller screen sizes to keep enough space between the lines for readability and therefore a responsive reaction.

**How to play? page:**

**Hamburger menu:** Repeat the verification steps done for the navbar on the Home page. Confirm that the hamburger menu code is identical on all HTML pages.

**Instructions:** Go to the "How to play?" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the title and all paragraph texts respond correctly, centre as expected and look good on all device widths. I had to adjust font size and padding-top of the title for this on smaller screen sizes.

**Turkey:** Go to the "How to play?" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the image display behaves and centres as expected and that it looks good on all device widths. The shake animation also works as expected at all times. 

**Footer:** Repeat the verification steps done for the footer on the Home page. Confirm that the footer code is identical on all HTML pages.

Review all functionality and responsiveness on my mobile phone and tablet for all pages.

## User Stories Testing 

1.	As a viewer of the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need, most importantly, to 
    find the quiz efficiently.

    - Regardless of which page the viewer is on, they can easily find and use the navigation bar, it also stays visible and on top of the screen even while scrolling.

    ![Hamburger bar](readme-images/1.userstory.png "Hamburger bar")

2.	As a potential new visitor to the website, I want to understand what the game is about and its rules.

    - By using the sticky navigation menu the user can easily navigate at any time to the "How to play?" page and read the instructions and purpose of the website. 

    ![Instructions](readme-images/2.userstory.png "Instructions")

3.  As a viewer of the website, I want to be able to see my final result and progression in the meantime.

    - After each round, after choosing an answer to the last, tenth question, the user will receive their final points that they achieved with a relevant message along, as well. This information will be displayed in the place of the quiz.
    
    ![Final point and message](readme-images/3a%20userstory.png "Final point and message")

    - With the interactive question counter bar and the score counter on the opposite side, the user can keep track of their journey and success in the game.
    
    ![Display bar](readme-images/3b%20userstory.png "Display bar")

4.  As an interested observer and/or hiring manager, I want to be able to find the web developer and see other projects 
    from her on social media and industry-relevant sites

    - Two website link icons can be found in the footer on every page of the website. One takes the visitor to the web developer’s LinkedIn profile page and the other to her Github profile page.
    
    ![Social media](readme-images/4.%20userstory.png "Social media").

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and browsers and report any issues they find. The height of the logo image was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page and also in media queries respectively. It was covering the let’s start button, the audio control buttons and the Rachel button in the middle of the page, therefore those didn’t work until the issue was resolved.

[Back to top](https://github.com/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/friends-quiz#contents)

## Bugs

A few issues came up while testing the website in the meantime; 

1. The encouraging message didn't work properly at some stage. This was an easy fix, as I realised that I was getting the wrong id from the html file, so after this was linked to the correct element.
2. The question counter was going over the number 10, instead of stopping at it and therefore didn't end the quiz properly. When I wanted to start a new round, the game went back to the end of the previous game. I resolved this issue by zeroing down the questionCounter at the end of the game, so it wouldn't overroll anymore. And a new quiz can start each time, also from question 1 again.
3. The questions also didn't restart if I wanted to play a new game with the same character as I previously did. This was resolved by the spread operator (...character.questions). Without this the code was pointing to the questions in the original array and later on with using splice method that was deleting the questions from the original array, therefore we had no questions left. So to restart the game for the same character, the spread operator creates a copy of the original array. 
4. While testing the quiz on mobile-sized screens, The let's start button, audio buttons and the Rachel button didn't work. This issue was resolved by adjusting the height of the logo-image (in media queries) as that was covering the mentioned buttons before.
