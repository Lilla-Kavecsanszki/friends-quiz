# User Experience (UX)


[Back to top](https://github.com/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/friends-quiz#contents)

### Ideal client


The ideal client for this business is:

-	English speaking
-	Friends fan
-   A person who watched the series 
-   Individuals, couples, families, or groups

Visitors of this website search for:

-	A knowledgeable site, where they can find story-based questions and challenging, engaging answer options 

This website is the best way to help them achieve these goals because:

- Most other similar sites are limited in their quiz games to a general Friends quiz, while this website offeres individual questionnaires for each characters
- The website also offers true story-based question scenarios and 4 answers to choose from that are just challenging enough


This website:

-	Is easy to navigate due to its sticky hamburger menu button scrolls with the user on all pages.
-   Gives the customers options and access to useful and learnable information.
-   Gives the customers the information they need without overloading them or distracting them from their original ideas  
    or wishes.
-   Guides them and their curiosity to the goal of the website
-   Has social media site buttons in the footer, which open them up in new tabs in order to not distract the customers  
    away from the website but a great help for the designer to showcase her other projects and work.

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing the website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile has scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse Accessibility](readme-images/accessibility_lighthouse_mobile%26desktop.png "Lighthouse Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for the Quiz logo and character buttons is Shadows Into Light, this was chosen because I found this font to be the closest to the one displayed in the title of the series. Therefore the user associates straight away to the topic of the website, without much explanation. 

![Shadows Into Light Font](readme-images/Shadows%20Into%20Light-font.png "Shadows Into Light Font")

The secondary font used for the body is Ubuntu which was selected for its clear readability, that works well with Shadows Into Light to maintain the cheerful and fun outcome.

![Ubuntu Font](readme-images/Ubuntu-font.png "Ubuntu Font")

I also chose a third font for the footer text, Quicksand, as I wanted to implement a much lighter font for that purpose, not to be distractive for the user.

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they find. Position of the text in cover-text was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page. They also reported that the dropdown menu doesn't work in an efficient way when viewed on mobile screens with Safari browser. Instead of a simple tap, they have to press the button for a longer period of time in order to drop down. In every other case, it worked perfectly, on Safari desktop screen size including.
