# Wireframes

Home page

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing the website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile has scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse Accessibility](readme-images/accessibility_lighthouse_mobile%26desktop.png "Lighthouse Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for headings and the navigation menu is Poiret One, this was chosen as it's easily readable, stylish with a little fun, and aims to give the idea of a modern and clean design.

The secondary font used for the body is Montserrat which was selected for its clear readability, which works well with Poiret One to maintain an elegant outcome.

## Manual Testing




## User Stories Testing 



## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they find. Position of the text in cover-text was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page. They also reported that the dropdown menu doesn't work in an efficient way when viewed on mobile screens with Safari browser. Instead of a simple tap, they have to press the button for a longer period of time in order to drop down. In every other case, it worked perfectly, on Safari desktop screen size including.
